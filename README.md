## Lab 3: Lossless Compression - Variable length coding
- Encode/Decode a text with Hufman coding

## Lab 4: Lossless Compression - Dictionary techniques
- Encode/Decode a text into LZW format
- Encode a text by using LZ77 algorithm
- Compare compression ratio between Deflate and LZW

## Lab 5: Quantization
- Functions for uniform quantization (gray/color) image, signal
