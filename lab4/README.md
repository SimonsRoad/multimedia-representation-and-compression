Exercise 1: LZW
    - file EncodeLzw.m : function EncodeLzw encodes a text into LZW format.
    - file DecodeLzw.m : function DecodeLzw 
    - file TestLzw.m : realize the test of encode and decode sequence into LZW format
    
Exercise 2: LZ77
    - file getLength.m : function getLength finds the length of matched string in sequence
                            start from an offset in search buffer and cursor position.
    - file EncodeLz77.m : function EncodeLz77 encodes text into the LZ77 format.
    - file TestLz77.m : realize the test of encode LZ77 with a sequence and a text file.
                        
Exercise 3: Deflate
    - file text.gz : result of command gzip to compress file text.txt
    - file Comparison.m : compute compression ratio of text file in LZW algorithm
